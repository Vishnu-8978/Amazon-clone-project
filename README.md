# Amazon-clone-project

*Structure:*

- A basic HTML structure with a header, banner, product grid, and footer.
- The header includes a logo, search bar, and navigation items (Sign In, Orders, Cart).
- The banner features a background image.
- The product grid displays four products with images, titles, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- The footer includes a copyright notice.

*Styling:*

- CSS is used to style the layout, colors, and typography.
- The header and footer have a dark background with white text.
- The product grid uses a grid layout with a gap between products.
- Each product has a white background, padding, and a subtle box shadow.

*Features:*

- The search bar is functional but doesn't actually search for anything (yet!).
- The "Add to Cart" buttons don't do anything (yet!).
- The navigation items (Sign In, Orders, Cart) are just links (yet!).
